# RateBuddy
RateBuddy is a social media platform where you can share your opinions and reviews about anything you want. What makes it unique is that other users can rate your reviews by giving them stars - so instead of just liking or commenting, people rate the quality of your review itself.

Think of it like this: you post your thoughts or a review, and the community tells you how helpful or insightful your review was by giving it a star rating. You can browse a feed of posts, see what's trending, and build your profile based on the quality of reviews you share.

It's perfect for people who want their opinions to be valued and rated by others!
